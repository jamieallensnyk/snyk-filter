# Custom Filtering for Snyk CLI
snyk-filter takes the JSON outputted from the [Snyk CLI](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360003812578-CLI-reference), e.g. `snyk test --json` and applies custom filtering of the results, as well as options to fail your build.

# How do I use it?

## Clone & Install

First, clone the repo.
Then run

`npm install -g`

### Note about `node-jq`

snyk-filter uses the `node-jq` library, which requires that a [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) binary is installed.  This typically happens transparently via `npm install -g`, but on some systems JQ does not get properly installed locally. If you receive an error after installation regarding `node-jq`, then `jq` should be installed manually to avoid this error.

```
# install jq ahead of time (ubuntu example)
sudo apt-get install -y jq

# tell node-jq to skip trying to install it on its own
export NODE_JQ_SKIP_INSTALL_BINARY=true

# tell node-jq where the existing jq binary is
export JQ_PATH=$(which jq)

# finally, install snyk-filter (does not work with node version > 12)
sudo npm i -g snyk-filter
```

## Usage

1. Implement your custom JQ filters in a .snyk-filter/snyk.yml file relative to your current working directory where you will be running snyk test from (see in [sample-filters](https://github.com/snyk-tech-services/snyk-filter/tree/develop/sample-filters) and tweak things from there - use [JQPlay](https://jqplay.org/) )

2. Then pipe your `snyk test --json` output into `snyk-filter` or use the `-i` argument to input a json file. Use the `-f` argument to point to the yml file containing your custom filters if you are not using the default location (.snyk-filter/snyk.yml).

3. Return code of snyk-filter will be 0 for pass (no issues) and 1 for fail (issues found)

### Example with Snyk CLI (using .snyk-filter/snyk.yml by default)
`snyk test --json | snyk-filter`

### Example with Snyk CLI and custom yml file location
`snyk test --json | snyk-filter -f /path/to/example-cvss-9-or-above.yml`

### Example
`snyk-filter -i snyk_results.json`

### Example with custom yml file location
`snyk-filter -i snyk_results.json -f /path/to/example-high-upgradeable-vulns.yml`

## Options
`--json` to output json
